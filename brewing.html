                        <p>
                            While in college, I worked in a bar.  My curiousity being what it is, I 
                              wanted to know what it takes to make beer.  Luckily Austin has enough
                              homebrew supply stores to get you started.  I've made many batches of 
                              brew.  Some for myself, some for friends, and even some for weddings.
                              Some batches are good, some not so much, but it doesn't matter because
                              making beer is a lot of work but worth it in the end.
