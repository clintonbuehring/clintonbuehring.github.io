                        <h1>Karnes City, the toughest small town in the Universe!</h1>

                        <p>
                            I grew up in Karnes City, Karnes for sort.  The best way I can describe
                              it's location to people I meet is it's the small town that you have to 
                              make a turn on when you travel to Port A.  It's more than that though.
                              It's a town of tough people and has been given the moniker as the toughest
                              town in Texas by my friends.  It's a town that slowly moves on into the 
                              future while still keeping a foot planted in the past...
